README file
A) My program is able to send the user to a welcome screen that welcomes them to the program. You press enter to continue, then it takes the user to the main menu with all the requirements. You can access the patients list, add patients, search patients by last name, and delete patients. Finaly wj=hen the user is done with the program, their is an exit screen that thanks them for using tha app.

B) Yes, there are a few little things that do not work in my project. I had some trouble with the display of patients list. I got it to list them in alphabetical order but I wasn't able to space them out like you wanted them. I also had some toruble witht the patient id. I have worked tirelesly for hours a day for the time we had to complete this project. I tired looking it up online, in the textbook to no success. I even tried going to the tutoring center at the campus and they did not help. I know that you had the online sessions to talk about the project, but I had a nother class at the time so I was not able to go. I am really stressed and burnt out that this project doesn't work 100%. I hope you could understand, I tried my best.

C) I have one additional feature when adding a patient it asks if you want to add another patient. You are able to add as amny patients as you want until you sellect the no option in the program.
